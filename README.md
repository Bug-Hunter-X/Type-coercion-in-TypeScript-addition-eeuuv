This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript related to type coercion during addition. The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers and return a number. However, due to TypeScript's type coercion rules, passing a string to the function does not trigger a compile-time error. Instead, the string is implicitly converted to a number, which can lead to unexpected results or runtime errors. The `bug.ts` file shows this issue in action, while `bugSolution.ts` presents a solution to prevent this issue.
